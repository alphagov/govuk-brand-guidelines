## Examples

Within app we lead with the Primary blue and Accent teal, from splash screen to core components.

Where appropriate we can introduce harmonious colours to aid with structure and hierarchy of content â€“ such as tints within cards or contextual colours that enhances navigation.

Colour should be applied in a way that does not add visual complexity or reduce accessibility.
