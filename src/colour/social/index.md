## Use colour to reflect tone

Our updated palette has been developed to allow a range in expression across the inform to inspire scale. 

There are moments where the brand needs to feel functional and serious, guiding users seamlessly to the content and services they need. With the introduction of new channels such as social, there are also moments where the brand needs impact and visual differentiation.

Within our palette there are two approaches to colour application: tonal colours and companion colours.

Depending on tonal requirement, each can be used to achieve a different level of expression. The following guidance details the use of these two approaches.

<!-- Obviously, that's not the right heading, needs proper design -->

### Inform <--------> Inspire

Tonal colour

Companion colour

### Tonal colour examples

Colour can be used to reflect tone of a message.

For more sensitive messaging, colours from within the same tonal range are used to feel more serious, informative and functional.

## Companion colours

Use companion colours when you need to emphasise something, like prompting action or sharing something positive. Weâ€™ve kept the set to 9 combinations to make sure they stay accessible.

Some pairings may be harder to see for people with visual impairments or colour blindness. 

Choose combinations carefully and use a tool like [WhoCanUse.com](https://www.whocanuse.com/) to check they meet [WCAG 2.2 Contrast (Minimum) Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

Do not rely on colour alone to show meaning, signal an action or prompt a response. For more detail, see [WCAG 2.2: Use of Colour (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html).

Remember, some users browse with high-contrast settings or dark mode. Colours may need to be adjusted to work in those contexts.
