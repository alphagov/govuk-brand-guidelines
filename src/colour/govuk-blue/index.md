title: GOV.UK is a blue brand
---

Our core brand colours are Primary blue and Accent teal.

Weâ€™re building on the Primary blue already in place to support recognition and trust. Using it more consistently will make it a clear visual signature of GOV.UK.

Accent teal also sits alongside to add impact and help the brand feel more modern.

## Coherency across channels

We lead with the Primary blue and Accent teal across all GOV.UK channels. From the blue header on web and app, to branded banners within social platforms, this aids brand recognition and establishes trust.

## Colour accessibility

You must make sure that the contrast ratio of colours used meets [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2) success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum).

## Incorrect colour usage

To maintain consistency across channels the colours within our palette should never be changed or altered. Exceptions to these recommendations must be approved by the brand team.

## Tailoring for GOV.UK channels

Each GOV.UK channel requires a different level of function and expression and therefore the palette has been tailored accordingly.
