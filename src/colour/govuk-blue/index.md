title: GOV.UK is a blue brand
---

Our core brand colours are Primary Blue and Accent Teal.

Weâ€™re building on the primary blue already in place to support recognition and trust. Using it more consistently will make it a clear visual signature of GOV.UK.

Accent teal also sits alongside to add impact and help the brand feel more modern.

## Coherency across channels

We lead with the Primary Blue and Accent Teal across all GOV.UK channels. From the blue header on web and app, to branded banners within social platforms, this aids brand recognition and establishes trust.
