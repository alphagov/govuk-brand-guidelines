This accessibility statement applies to \[scope of statement, for example, website or domain to which the statement applies\].

<!--
Note: use this section to make a brief, general statement about what the website allows disabled users to do. Base it on the evaluation covered in detail in the ‘Technical information about this website’s accessibility’ section.

It must be specific to your own website. If you’re not confident that something is accurate, leave it out. If you’re not confident enough to say anything specific here, leave this section out completely.

<!--
Note: this wording is legally required and must not be changed.
-->

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2\) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

<!--
Note: if your organisation is based in Northern Ireland, refer users who want to complain to the [Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI)](https://www.equalityni.org/Home) instead of the EASS and EHRC.

You must link to either the EASS or ECNI websites.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

<!--
Note: this wording is legally required and must not be changed.
-->

\[Name of organisation\] is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2\) Accessibility Regulations 2018\.

## Compliance status

The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.

<!--
Note: say that the website is fully compliant if the website meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard in full.

Say that it’s partially compliant if it meets most requirements of the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.

If it does not meet most requirements of the WCAG 2.2 AA standard, say that it’s not compliant.

If your website is either partially compliant or not compliant with the WCAG 2.2 AA standard, you’ll need to explain why. This will be due to one or both of the following:

* non-compliances - this means the content in question is in scope of the regulations, but there’s an accessibility problem with it
* an exemption - this means the inaccessible content is out of scope of the regulations, or it’d be a disproportionate burden for you to make it accessible

There’s a legally required way of expressing the compliance status of your website, so do not change it. Choose one of the options below, for example (a), (b) or (c), and delete those not applicable.
-->

\[Select (a) only if all requirements of the technical specification are fully met without exceptions for WCAG 2.2.\]

(a) This website is fully compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA standard.

\[Select (b) if most requirements of the technical specification are met, but with some exceptions. This means not yet fully compliant and that the necessary measures are to be taken in order to reach full compliance.\]

(b) This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA standard, due to \[insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’\] listed below.

\[Select (c) if most requirements of the technical specification are not met.\]

(c) This website is not compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA standard. The \[insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’\] are listed below.

<!--
Note: delete the options that do not apply.
-->

## Non-accessible content

<!--
Note: if the website is fully compliant with the standard, you can leave the ‘Non-accessible content’ section out.

Otherwise, do not change the ‘Non-accessible content’ heading or the ‘The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons’ sentence \- they’re legally required.

Do not change the ‘Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations’, ‘Disproportionate burden’ and ‘Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations’ subheadings: they’re also legally required.

But if you need to list a lot of problems, you can break these subsections up with further subheadings \- for example, ‘Navigation and accessing information’ or ‘Interactive tools and transactions’.
-->

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

## Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

<!--
Note: In this subsection, list:

* accessibility problems
* which of the WCAG success criteria the problem fails on
* when you plan to fix the problem

Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).

These are examples only. Your statement must be specific to your website.
-->

...

## Disproportionate burden

<!--
Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix.

You must carry out [an assessment](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-website-and-mobile-application-accessibility-monitoring#disproportionate-burden-claims-and-assessment) before claiming disproportionate burden.

Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too.

These are examples only. Your statement should be specific to your website.
-->

...

## Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

<!--
Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems that fall outside the scope of the accessibility regulations.
-->

...

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

<!--
Note: publishing an accessibility roadmap is optional. It’s a good idea to publish one if you want to be specific about the order you’re planning to tackle accessibility issues, and there’s no space to do so in the accessibility statement itself.
-->

Our accessibility roadmap \[add link to roadmap\] shows how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this website.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

<!--
Note: the wording about when the statement was prepared and reviewed is required.

It is recommended that an audit be carried out following a substantial revision to your website. The statement must also be updated.

The statement must be reviewed at least once a year, even if there have not been significant changes to the website. Include the date of the last review.
