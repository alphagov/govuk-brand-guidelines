Data visualisation refers to the graphic representation of data. Visual elements, like lines, shapes and colours, are used to convey information to users.

Visualising data can help to communicate information that may otherwise be lost due to its complexity.

Surfacing these details in a clear and easy to understand way, allows users to make sense of complex information quickly and confidently. Users become more informed and equipped to make relevant decisions.

## Principles

When creating visualisations for GOV.UK, we ensure they are:

### 1. Clear

By understanding user needs, we provide only the relevant information and reduce unnecessary complexity. We leverage a visual hierarchy, consistent labelling, and align with the core brand to maintain clarity.

### 2. Accessible

We are committed to providing everyone access to the same content. We avoid using colour alone to convey information, use appropriate text contrast ratios, and provide alternative versions of the same data.

### 3. Accurate

We take great care in ensuring visualisations are true and accurate representations of the underlying data. This includes, consistent intervals, starting at zero where appropriate, citing sources, and providing supporting information.

### 4. Consistent

A consistent approach to data visualisation enhances clarity, accessibility, and accuracy. Consistency allows users to gain familiarity and improve their understanding.

### 5. Engaging

Our principles and core brand allow us to create visualisations that are relevant, engaging and memorable. So users are more informed when they need it most.

## Conveying a clear narrative to users

When creating visualisations for GOV.UK, we ensure:

### 1. We know its purpose

Before you begin visualising data, take the time to clearly define the purpose of the visualisation.

Understanding your user needs and their level of expertise on the subject will guide your design decisions. It will also help ensure your data story is both meaningful and effective with your users.

### 2. We know the story

Effective data visualisation is about storytelling and communicating insight. Structure your visuals to tell a story and support the overarching narrative.

### 3. We know what is important

Avoid overwhelming your users with too much information. Strip away unnecessary distractions and prioritise your information with a focus on clarity and accessibility.

## Selecting a visualisation type

Different visualisation techniques are better suited for different types of data and messages. Choosing which one to use will depend on the

- message conveyed
- statistical relationships within the data
- target audience

The table below, originally produced by ONS Analysis Function, provides examples of different statistical relationships. It also suggests the type of chart that would work best for a specific example.

| Relationship  | Example                                        | Recommended chart types                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Distribution  | Population by age                              | Bar chart, population pyramid, box plot, dot plot |
| Time          | Price inflation over time                      | Line chart, calendar heat map                     |
| Rank          | Schools ranked by performance                  | Bar chart, lollipop chart, slope chart            |
| Deviation     | Rail company performance compared with target  | Bar chart, dot plot                               |
| Correlation   | Relationship between weight and height         | Scatterplot, line graph                           |
| Magnitude     | Average income by region                       | Bar chart                                         |
| Spatial       | Geographical clusters of notifiable diseases   | Map                                               |
| Part-to-whole | Total economic production by industrial sector | Pie chart, donut chart, tree map, bubble chart    |
| Flow          | Trade between countries                        | Sankey graph                                      |

## Creating dashboards

A dashboard is a visual tool that shows different views of data to provide an overview of a specific topic. A dashboard will normally be a combination of several charts or important values. It is typically updated regularly or automatically, so a user can monitor it over time.

### Use a dashboard when:

- Communicating high-level indicators, not detailed insights
- The topic is high priority with users likely to have prior knowledge
- The data updates frequently and users revisit often
- Data can be updated automatically with minimal maintenance

Ensure you have clear justification based on your users’ needs.

### Disadvantages of dashboards:

Dashboards have drawbacks and are best used for high-level data. They often:

- Don't highlight key findings, leaving interpretation to users
- Struggle with data needing extensive explanation
- Can quickly become outdated as user needs change
- Require frequent maintenance for updates
- Are challenging to make accessible on different devices

For complex insights, use multiple charts in a single publication or try scrollytelling to change focus as users scroll.

### Tips

A careful hierarchy and structure can limit overwhelming users with information.

Support both learning and exploration with guidance and concise explanations.

Avoid using third-party packages for more control over the user experience (including accessibility and responsive design).

## Creating interactive visualisations

An interactive chart allows the user to change what the chart shows by taking an action.

### Use an interactive visualisation when:

Only consider using an interactive visualisation where the most important information for the user cannot be clearly shown through a non-interactive chart.

Use interactive visualisations when:

- users are likely to be most interested in personalising their data such as seeing data about their local authority
- there is not a clear way of displaying data without interactivity
- there are several interests or narratives across different locations or categories

### Disadvantages of interactive charts:

Interactive visualisation need the user to make a selection to see information. This may:

- make it more difficult for users to get messages
- hide the main messages from users

Interactive visualisations are also more complex and time consuming to produce; there may not always be enough resource to create an interactive chart.

If an interactive visual is not suitable, use charts that highlight the main points of interest or findings without needing user input. Consider using several small charts, known as small multiples, to avoid using too many categories in a single visualisation.

### Tips

Some platforms may only accept certain image sizes or file formats.

If you’re publishing on a platform or using a content management system, check for any existing recommendations.
