## App splash screen

The app splash screen utilises the dot in motion to represent GOV.UK bringing together government services and departments, all in one place.

<!-- TODO: these files are partly duplicated in
logo system > app and colour > palette overview -->

{% grid { columns: { desktop: 2 }, classes: "govuk-!-padding-bottom-6" } %}

<div>
    
 ### App splash screen (long version)

<video src="./splash-screen-long-version.mp4" controls width="405" style="max-width: 100%"></video>

</div>
<div>

### App splash screen (short version)

<video src="./splash-screen-short-version.mp4" controls width="405" style="max-width: 100%"></video>

</div>
{% endgrid %}

## Illustration

The dot can be brought to life through animation in illustrations, adding personality and expression to moments such as app onboarding, or to tell visual stories within social.

## Social media

Within the context of social media, strong brand expression and impact are essential for capturing attention and driving engagement.

With content competing for visibility, our brand needs to stand out through more impactful visuals and dynamic motion.

To ensure consistency across all content, our dot graphic language should serve as a unifying anchor, reinforcing brand recognition and cohesion.

The dot provides a distinctive, flexible visual thread that ties together different content types, ensuring our brand remains instantly recognisable across content, thumbnails and profiles.

### Social end frames

To build coherence across channels, our social end frames follow the same motion behaviour as the app splash screen.

<div>

### Video end frame 16:9

<video src="./End-frame-1920-1080.mp4" controls width="720" style="max-width: 100%"></video>

</div>
{% endgrid %}

{% grid { columns: { tablet: 2 } } %}

<div>

### Video end frame 9:16

<video src="./End-frame-1080-1920.mp4" controls width="402" style="max-width: 100%"></video>

</div>
<div>

### Video end frame 1:1

<video src="./End-frame-1080-1080.mp4" controls width="720" style="max-width: 100%"></video>

</div>
{% endgrid %}

## Video thumbnails

We can build on our dot graphic language to create engaging thumbnails that encourage user interaction.

Dot behaviours provide flexibility in how thumbnails can be created for a variety of content types, across a scale from informing to inspiring.

Thumbnails should always use the dot in a purposeful way.

See these indicative examples of dot use within thumbnails. These examples are shown for illustrative purposes only.

## Static dot examples

The dot can also be used as a static graphic, adding emphasis and helping guide users through content.

See these indicative examples of static dot graphics. These examples are shown for illustrative purposes only.

## Static dot storyboard

While it's important to use the dot in a purposeful way, it can effectively guide user attention and break down information to enhance the overall experience.

See this indicative example of the dot used throughout a storyboard. This example is shown for illustrative purposes only.

Such as in the instagram story below;
