## App splash screen

The app splash screen utilises the dot in motion to represent GOV.UK bringing together government services and departments, all in one place.

{% grid { columns: { desktop: 2 } } %}

<div>
    
 ### App splash screen (long version)

{% video { source: [
    "./splash-screen-long-version.mp4",
    "./splash-screen-long-version.webm"
] } %}

</div>
<div>

### App splash screen (short version)

{% video { source: [
    "./splash-screen-short-version.mp4",
    "./splash-screen-short-version.webm"
] } %}

</div>
{% endgrid %}

### Video description

No audio. The dot leads a trail of other dots of various colours in a spiral towards the centre of a mobile screen, where it becomes the dot within the GOV.UK logo as it fades and pushes in. The crown logo is revealed by an circular iris effect at the bottom of the screen.

## Illustration

The dot can be brought to life through animation in illustrations, adding personality and expression to moments such as app onboarding, or to tell visual stories within social.

## Social media

Within the context of social media, strong brand expression and impact are essential for capturing attention and driving engagement.

With content competing for visibility, our brand needs to stand out through more impactful visuals and dynamic motion.

To ensure consistency across all content, our dot graphic language should serve as a unifying anchor, reinforcing brand recognition and cohesion.

The dot provides a distinctive, flexible visual thread that ties together different content types, ensuring our brand remains instantly recognisable across content, thumbnails and profiles.

### Social end frames

To build coherence across channels, our social end frames follow the same motion behaviour as the app splash screen.

<div>

### Video end frame 16:9

{% video { source: [
    "./End-frame-1920-1080.mp4",

{% endgrid %}

{% grid { columns: { tablet: 2 }, classes: "govuk-!-padding-bottom-6 govuk-!-padding-top-4" } %}

{% endgrid %}

## Video thumbnails

We can build on our dot graphic language to create engaging thumbnails that encourage user interaction.

Dot behaviours provide flexibility in how thumbnails can be created for a variety of content types, across a scale from informing to inspiring.

Thumbnails should always use the dot in a purposeful way.

Indicative examples for illustrative purposes only.
{% endcallout %}

{% informInspire { contentClasses: 'app-inform-inspire__content--flex app-inform-inspire__content--flex-2-items' } %}
{% figure { src: "./video-thumb-get-help.png", alt: "A video thumbnail for 'Get help with registering a death'. Title is shown within a simple blue circle graphic on a blue background.", classes: "govuk-!-text-align-left"  } %}
Get help with...
{% endfigure %}
{% figure { src: "./video-thumb-influencer.png", alt: "A video thumbnail for 'How I learnt to drive. A smiling young adult is shown in front of a purple background, with the title in a dark purple circle." } %}

{% endfigure %}
{% endinformInspire %}

## Static dot examples

The dot can also be used as a static graphic, adding emphasis and helping guide users through content.

{% endcallout %}

{% grid { columns: { mobile: 2, tablet: 4 } } %}

<div>

## Static dot storyboard

While it's important to use the dot in a purposeful way, it can effectively guide user attention and break down information to enhance the overall experience.

{% grid { columns: { desktop: 1, tablet: 1, mobile: 1 } } %}
{% gridCell %}

## Incorrect dot usage

The dot has defined roles and behaviours, set out earlier in this guidance.

To keep things consistent, avoid the following:

{% grid { columns: { mobile: 1, tablet: 2 } } %}
{% gridCell %}

    ### Overuse

    Do not overuse the dot

    ![Crossed out graphic with a small blank dot on the top left. Text placed in the centre within a large circle, and also contains a lozenge-shaped text highlight.](./incorrect-overuse.svg)
    {% endgridCell %}
    {% gridCell %}

    ### Decorative elements

    Do not use the dot in a decorative way

    ![Crossed out graphic some text, with a dot placed off-centre in the background.](./incorrect-decorative.svg)
    {% endgridCell %}
    {% gridCell %}

    ### Distortions

    Do not distort or skew the dot

    ![Crossed out graphic with some text placed inside a stretched-out oval.](./incorrect-distorted.svg)
    {% endgridCell %}
    {% gridCell %}

    ### Stroke

    Do not use stroke versions of the dot

    ![Crossed out graphic of a circular outline, resembling a ring.](./incorrect-stroke.svg)
    {% endgridCell %}
    {% gridCell {verticalAlign: 'end'} %}

    ### Crops

    Do not use abstract crops of the dot

    ![Crossed out graphic showing only the cropped corner of a large circle.](./incorrect-crop.svg)
    {% endgridCell %}
    {% gridCell %}

    ### Filters and effects

    Do not apply shadows or gradients
