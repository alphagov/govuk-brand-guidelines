## The dot

Our dot is the bridge between government and the UK, by the side of users to help make information and services easier and more useful.

Used within our wordmark and as a graphic device across all GOV.UK channels, the dot is a guiding hand, for life.

No audio. The dot starts from its place within the GOV.UK logo, then playfully expands, bounces and moves through a range of animation examples that introduce government information and services.
