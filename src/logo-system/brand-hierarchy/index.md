## Lock-up system

A lock-up is a fixed layout that combines GOV.UK brand elements – the crown or wordmark – with text.

In most cases, the text names an ingredient brand, channel or service (you can find more on this in the brand hierarchy diagram in the introduction).

Lock-ups help show the relationship between GOV.UK and the service, channel or department they support.

We have five versions:

1. Horizontal
2. Horizontal with crown
3. Stacked (web)
4. Stacked (apps)
5. Stacked with crown

To keep the brand consistent, use each version exactly as shown – do not resize, reposition or remove any part.

The diagrams on this page show how to space the wordmark and text in a lock-up. Use the width of the dot in the GOV.UK wordmark to set the spacing.
