## Lock-up system

A lock-up is a fixed layout that combines GOV.UK brand elements – the crown or wordmark – with text.

In most cases, the text names an ingredient brand, channel or service (you can find more on this in the brand hierarchy diagram in the introduction).

Lock-ups help show the relationship between GOV.UK and the service, channel or department they support.

We have five versions:

1. [Horizontal](#horizontal)
2. [Horizontal with crown](#horizontal-with-crown)
3. [Stacked for web](#stacked-for-web)
4. [Stacked for apps](#stacked-for-app)
5. [Stacked with crown](#stacked-with-crown)

To keep the brand consistent, use each version exactly as shown – do not resize, reposition or remove any part.

The diagrams on this page show how to space the wordmark and text in a lock-up. Use the width of the dot in the GOV.UK wordmark to set the spacing.

In both horizontal and stacked lock-ups, the space between the wordmark and product name should be the width of the dot.

Use the width and height of the G in the GOV.UK wordmark to set the overall margin spacing.
