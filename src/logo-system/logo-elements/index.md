## Wordmark

Our wordmark has been redrawn, elevating the dot into a position that signifies the connection between government and the UK.

As our primary identifier, the GOV.UK wordmark should be used in all applications of the logo.

The exception to this rule is the GOV.UK website. See the Web Logo section (3.3) for more details.

## Crown

As our primary identifier, the GOV.UK wordmark should be used in all applications of the logo.

The exception to this rule is the GOV.UK website. See the [Web – Logo system page](/logo-system/web/).

### Using the crown as a supporting element

A lock-up system where we can position the crown in close proximity to the GOV.UK wordmark to offer greater flexibility when designing in a wider range of formats and channels.

## Lock-up

The elements that make up our logo lock-up are all scaled using the dot from within the crown.

The spacing between the crown and the wordmark is 3 dots, and the dot within the wordmark is 2 dots in width.

This ensures visual balance and harmony between the elements.

The pixel sizes displayed on this page are indicative and will vary across devices.

![TODO](./lockup-detail.svg)

{% endsectionHighlight %}

### Use proportional scaling

In order to maintain visual hierarchy, consistency and balance between the two elements, scaling of the crown should be proportional to the wordmark.

The size of the crown can be adjusted depending on context. For example, when being used at smaller sizes such as within the app icon, the enlarged crown should be used to aid accessibility and legibility.

#### Standard crown size

Scaling should follow this rule:
Wordmark dot = 2× crown dot

![TODO](./propotional-scaling-desktop.svg)

{% endsectionHighlight %}

#### Enlarged crown size

Scaling should follow this rule:
Wordmark dot = 1× crown dot

### Maintain clear space around logo elements

Maintaining clear space around the logo is essential to ensure its visibility, impact, and legibility.

By respecting clear space guidelines, we preserve the logo’s integrity and ensure it remains a strong and recognisable brand asset.

The clear space area is defined by the dot size within our wordmark.

## Minimum sizing

Keeping the logo at its minimum size helps ensure it stays legible and accessible.

If it’s too small, it can lose detail and be harder for some users to read or recognise.
