## Web use lock-up

To aid recognition and trust we retain the locked-up version of the crown and wordmark on web.

{% sectionHighlight { classes: 'app-section-highlight--logo' } %}

![](./web-logo-primary.svg)

{% endsectionHighlight %}

## Header and footer

The lock-up combining the crown and wordmark is for use throughout the web experience, in moments such as the web header and footer.

{% callout %}

{% endcallout %}

We also use the crown as a supporting element within the footer at the end of content.

## Favicon

In line with minimum size guidance, within web favicons we use the simplified crown. This is to retain legibility and brand recognition and small sizes.
