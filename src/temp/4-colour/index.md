# Colour

Our colour palette is designed with accessibility in mind. It’s flexible enough to work across all GOV.UK channels.

This section explains how to apply colour so it meets accessibility standards and helps everyone understand information clearly.

Always use the GOV.UK colour palette alongside other accessibility principles. This includes using accessible colour combinations and ensuring meaning is never conveyed by colour alone.


## GOV.UK is a blue brand

Our core brand colours are Primary Blue and Accent Teal.

We’re building on the primary blue already in place to support recognition and trust. Using it more consistently will make it a clear visual signature of GOV.UK.

Accent teal also sits alongside to add impact and help the brand feel more modern.
