# Web

## Web use lock-up

To aid recognition and trust we retain the locked-up version of the crown and wordmark on web.

<!--
TODO:
- shouldn't be referencing file in other folder
- it's probably not the correct file either
-->

## Header

The lock-up combining the crown and wordmark is for use throughout the web experience, in moments such as the web header and footer.

<!-- TODO: There is no text in the PDF but should have something here -->

## Favicon

In line with minimum size guidance, within web favicons we use the simplified crown. This is to retain legibility and brand recognition and small sizes.
