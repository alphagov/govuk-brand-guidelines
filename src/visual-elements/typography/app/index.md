## GDS Transport within app

GDS Transport is our primary brand typeface.

Using it within our apps can provide significant advantages, particularly in strengthening brand recognition and creating a cohesive user experience across platforms and channels.

Whilst there may be cases where it is not possible, we should always try to use GDS Transport where possible.

## OS native fonts

It may not always be possible to use GDS Transport, such as within native operating system environments. In such cases, it is recommended to use the platform’s default system typeface to ensure consistency, performance, and accessibility.

For example:

- **Apple (iOS, macOS):** Use SF Pro, the system font designed for optimal legibility and integration with Apple’s UI.

Using the system typeface ensures better performance, scalability, and adherence to platform conventions, resulting in a more polished and user-friendly app, it does however effect brand recognition and consistency.
